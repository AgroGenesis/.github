# Agro-Genesis

Agro-Genesis, a mobile application using Flutter, Machine Learning, Firestore, and Flask to bridge the gap between farmers and technology. Here's what makes our app special:
🔑 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
𝐅𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐫-𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Understanding the needs of farmers, we created a simple OTP-based registration, enabling even those with limited smartphone knowledge to join effortlessly.
𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬: Powered by the OpenWeather API, farmers can access daily weather forecasts, helping them make informed decisions for their crops.
𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: With the help of a Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning model, our app suggests the most suitable crops based on crucial soil parameters like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), rainfall, humidity, pH levels, season and the regional details.
𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤: We provide a platform for farmers to connect with suppliers of seeds, fertilizers, machinery, and more — all essential for successful farming.
🔮 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:
𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐘𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Soon, we'll introduce crop yield prediction, empowering farmers to forecast their harvest based on soil data.
𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐥: We aim to create a dedicated portal where suppliers and laborers can register, offering a transparent and efficient connection between farmers and service providers.
𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 & 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Farmers will be able to sell their produce directly to consumers via an online marketplace, with secure payment options included for seamless transactions.
This journey was an incredible learning experience for our entire team, showing us the impact technology can have on agriculture. We are thrilled to continue building on this project and making a meaningful difference in the lives of farmers.
